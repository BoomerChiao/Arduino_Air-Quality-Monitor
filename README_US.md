The Arduino based air quality monitoring system combines several sensors to measure various environmental factors.


##  Summary　（概要）
The Arduino Air Quality Monitor is a high-performance air quality monitoring device designed based on the Arduino Pro Mini microcontroller (MCU). It integrates multiple advanced sensing technologies to provide precise monitoring of environmental air quality.

The device is equipped with the SGP40 gas sensor module (for detecting TVOC and CO2 concentrations), AHT20 and SHT40 temperature and humidity sensors, which can accurately measure the temperature and humidity levels in the air. Moreover, the PMS9003M air particulate matter sensor measures concentrations of PM1.0, PM2.5, and PM10, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of airborne particulate pollutants.

For display, the system uses either a TFT color LCD screen or an OLED display panel, offering intuitive, real-time visual presentation of various air quality indicators, moving beyond traditional warning lights or monotonous numeric displays. This not only enables users to easily monitor environmental changes but also aids in the long-term collection and analysis of data, leading to effective air quality management and optimization, ultimately enhancing the air quality in living and working spaces.

##  Arduino Pro or Pro Mini USB to UART Hookup Guide　（Arduino Pro、Pro Mini USB 燒入連接指南）
The Arduino Pro Mini and Arduino Pro are compact, low-power versions of the Arduino board. To program these boards or communicate with them via a computer, you'll need a USB-to-UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) adapter.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06e75a60-4666-4329-bbba-8ee2ec47657e)
Picture from：https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/how-to-connect-an-arduino-pro-mini-to-a-pc-via-a-usb-to-serial-module.77010/
1. Steps to Connections
   - USB-to-UART Adapter VCC → Arduino Pro Mini VCC
     - USB-to-UART Adapter Pins Connect to Arduino Pro Mini VCC (make sure it matches the voltage of your Pro Mini)
   - USB-to-UART Adapter GND → Arduino Pro Mini GND
   - USB-to-UART Adapter TX → Arduino Pro Mini RX
   - USB-to-UART Adapter RX → Arduino Pro Mini TX
   - USB-to-UART Adapter DTR → Arduino Pro Mini DTR
2. Troubleshooting Tips
   - Check Connections： Ensure all wires are connected securely and to the correct pins.
   - Verify Voltage： Make sure the VCC connection matches the voltage requirements of your Pro Mini.
   - Auto-reset： If uploading code fails, try manually pressing the reset button on the Pro Mini just before uploading.

‼️P.S. For the activation or deactivation condition of the TVOC enhanced mode, ground the D7 pin for 3 seconds, then release the D7 pin to trigger the activation or deactivation of the TVOC enhanced mode.

##  Advanced Design　（進階設計）
To simplify the electronics manufacturing process, PCB printing technology can be used to replace messy and difficult-to-manage wiring.

This not only significantly reduces the risk of incorrect connections but also enhances the stability and reliability of the product. Especially in compact devices, PCBs can effectively integrate intricate circuit layouts, reduce size, and improve production efficiency, making the product thinner and more powerful.

###  Circuit Design （電路設計）
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc58c8ef-e276-4195-9208-d72b3a10fb52)
- The small capacitor on the left-side MCU I/O pins suppresses low-frequency noise and improves signal stability.
- The pull-up resistors on the I²C interface ensure proper SCL and SDA operation, reducing the risk of signal floating and data errors.
- Connector USB1 is designed for USB Type-C charging input, with a 5.1kΩ pull-down resistor on the CC pin to identify the device as a Sink, enabling correct power supply from the Source.
- Connector U7 is compatible with the IP5306 charging management module for easy connection.


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ecd17ff-f9c4-4eb9-860a-081d3e06b4e9)
- Power management： The IP5306 is used for power management, featuring boost functionality and multi-functional battery power management. It significantly reduces the need for surrounding components and effectively minimizes the size of the power module.
- Voltage Monitoring： The voltage monitoring circuit is designed based on a resistive voltage divider, which compresses the input voltage to a range that can be read by the controller, enabling effective voltage monitoring.
- The U10 button is primarily used to trigger the grounding of the D7 pin, thereby activating or completing specific functional applications.
- The remaining modules PMS1, SGP, AHT_A, SHT, OLED, and LCD are all modular sockets used to connect the corresponding sensors and display modules.
